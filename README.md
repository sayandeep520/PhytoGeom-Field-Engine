# PhytoGeom-Field-Engine
A computational physics suite for Metabolic Geometrodynamics. PhytoGeom maps biological networks as Riemannian manifolds, solving the Ricci-Dissipation Field Equation to predict phase transitions. Using the MTBLS39 and MTBLS1 datasets, it identifies "Geometric Shockwaves" and the Universal Scaling Factor (Lambda) for life.
